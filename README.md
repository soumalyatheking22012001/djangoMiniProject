Welcome to the djangoMiniProject wiki!
# First log in with localhost:8000
With `username` and `password` which I create in the database previously.
The authentication is very simple just to match username of the user's name.
# Second click edit button to edit email address
After that, click save button to save new email address and then the page refreshes itself to show new email address.
# About unit test
I wrote a simple unit test to test edit email form.
I tried to use selenium to test the view to edit email but failed.Because the modal is triggered by clicking a button and there's always an exception that the form is not visible and interactable.I don't know how to make it visible yet.
